# JCSPyGm #

JCSPyGm is a framework provide basic 2D features and structure for
building the a simple game. This framework uses PyGm API to communicate
with OS layer. <br/><br/>


## Feature ##
* Animation System - render animation frame by frame control by time. <br/>
* Animator System - animator control multiple animations and can be 
switch from one animation to another animation. <br/>
* Camera System - camera logic implemented with moving the scene in 
the opposite direction/velocity. <br/>
* Input System - encapsulate the input buffer to a easy to use API.
* Rendering Layer - rendering game object in different interface. <br/>
* Scene System - simple switch scene system. <br/>
* Simple Collision detection - AABB, Circle to circle, Rectangle to circle.
* Sound System - provide simple sound function. <br/>
 
 
## Example Project ##
* Is already included in the project.
